# MCRestart

Automatically restarts a Minecraft server after /stop has been executed.

This project is -NOT- recommended as a fail-safe against server crashes, and can actually cause more harm than good in that case.

It can be used as a companion to any Bukkit plugin that automatically restarts a server at a scheduled time/interval.

Run with ./start.sh craftbukkit.jar
